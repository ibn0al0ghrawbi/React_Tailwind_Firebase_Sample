## React Sample with the use of Tailwind, Firebase as backend and AntDesign for component style


#### This project was started as part of the SoftServe training program as part of a group project. My task was to create a hackathon website from a Figma template (using TailwindCSS) and modify the data dynamically via some kind of backend. In the admin-panel I used AntDesign Components (Table, Modal, Buttons, Form) and communicate via a firebase, where the data can be changed, deleted and added and dynamically rendered on the website. (Attention, if the data can not be changed, possibly the free monthly data volume of firebase was used up).
